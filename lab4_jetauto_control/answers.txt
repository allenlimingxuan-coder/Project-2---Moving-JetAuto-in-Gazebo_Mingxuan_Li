Q1. What command did you use to launch the JetAuto robot in Gazebo?
LIDAR_TYPE=A1 roslaunch jetauto_gazebo worlds.launch

Q2. Which two other launch files were called when you launched worlds.launch?
1. empty_world.launch
2. spawn_model.launch

Q3. Describe the process of setting up your ROS workspace and creating the project package.
1) Created a catkin workspace using mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
2) Built the workspace using catkin_make
3) Created the package lab4_jetauto_control with dependencies rospy and geometry_msgs
4) Wrote a Python node that publishes geometry_msgs/Twist messages to /jetauto_controller/cmd_vel
5) Ran the node using rosrun while Gazebo was running
6) Verified the messages using rostopic echo

Q4. What challenges did you face while making the robot move in a straight line while turning, and how did you overcome them?
The robot did not move in a perfect square due to timing and speed differences. I adjusted the linear and angular velocities and durations to improve the path and make it closer to a square.

GenAI usage: ChatGPT was used to help understand ROS concepts and assist with writing the Python control script.
